ChaosApp Discord Bot
====================

This Bot is currently in public beta. Please let me know if you have any
problems and I will try to address them quickly. 

Basic Usage
-----------

1. ``/f`` The slash command to obtain a fractal from the Bot library
2. ``/fract`` The slash command to compute a new fractal

Note that both of these slash commands are subject to
constraints on the server's current computational burden and may be
delayed or fail depending on the current load.
